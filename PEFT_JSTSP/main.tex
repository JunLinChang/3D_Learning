\section{Biography Section}
%If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed), extra braces are
 %needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
 %the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
 %$\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command within an optional argument. (You can create
 %your own custom macro containing the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command to make things
 %simpler here.)
