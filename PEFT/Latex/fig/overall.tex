	\caption{Overview of the proposed PLT framework. During fine-tuning, the pre-trained backbone network is frozen, and only the PLT branch and the class token are fine-tuned. The PLT branch comprises two primary components: (1) the Set Abstraction (SA) module and (2) the Local-Global Fusion (LGF) module.
