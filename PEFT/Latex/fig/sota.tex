    \caption{The comparison of several methods on the hardest variant of ScanObjectNN\cite{uy2019revisiting}. Different shapes stand for different methods. Blue and green respectively represent the results under the PointMAE\cite{pang2022masked} and PointBERT\cite{yu2022point} baselines. The darker the color, the higher the accuracy (The accuracy is mapped to the range [0,1] by using max-min scaling\cite{panda2014smoothing}).
